# YouTube (and other video sites)

The video goes on the student's own channel, so the student uploads it and decides when the world can see it. You prepare everything else.

## Before the upload

- Upload the master render from `video/out/` (full quality). The web copy in `public/video/` is squeezed under 10 MB for the website and looks worse on a big screen.
- Write the details in `video/videos.json`, one entry per video: `file` (the master's name), `title`, `description`, `tags`, `language` and `captions` (the `.vtt` file, or none). The description ends with "Narrated with an AI voice." and the app's address. Show the file to the student and wait for a yes.
- The script's rules apply to the title and description too: benefits only, nothing a stranger would not care about, no claim the app cannot back up.

## The upload

1. The student opens YouTube Studio signed in to their channel and drags the mp4 from `video/out/` into the upload window. Browser tools that upload files for an agent often stop at about 10 MB, so this drag is theirs.
2. Visibility: **Private** first. They watch it once on YouTube, on a phone too, then choose Unlisted or Public themselves.
3. Details: paste them from `videos.json`. If you can operate their browser and they say yes, you may fill in the fields. Never press Publish or change the visibility for them.
4. Subtitles:
   - The video already shows its words in the picture (the silent cut, or a phone cut with captions): turn off (unpublish) YouTube's automatic subtitles for that video. Otherwise a viewer who turns subtitles on sees the words twice.
   - The voiced cut without words in the picture: upload its `.vtt` file as the subtitles, in the language the video speaks. Its timing comes from the voice step, so it is closer than YouTube's own guess.
5. YouTube may ask whether the video has altered or synthetic content. Read the question with the student and answer it truthfully. Keep "Narrated with an AI voice." in the description either way.

## Never

- Never delete or replace a published video for the student, even a wrong one. Say what is wrong and ask them to do it in Studio. Deleting loses the video's views and links, and it cannot be undone.
- Never change the channel's settings, monetisation or default upload settings.
- Never upload a video that shows a real customer's data or a real account.
