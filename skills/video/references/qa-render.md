# Check with stills, then render

All commands run inside `<appDir>/video` (use `cd "<appDir>/video" && ...`). `scripts/stills.mjs` and `scripts/vspecs.mjs` belong to the video engine, not to the Shipyard plugin: they exist only after `video-setup.mjs` has copied the engine into that folder. One command at a time, in the foreground.

## Stills first (cheap)

```
node scripts/stills.mjs <tag> light                 # one frame near the end of every scene, tiled
node scripts/stills.mjs <tag> dark
VERTICAL=1 COLS=6 node scripts/stills.mjs <tag> light $(node scripts/vspecs.mjs <tag>)   # on Windows run vspecs first and paste its output
SILENT=1 node scripts/stills.mjs <tag> light
```

Stills land in `out/stills/`. Open each sheet with the Read tool and look. Check:

- cropped or empty frames, text running out of its box
- a cursor or highlight ring that is not on its target
- wrong or invented claims, wrong spelling of the product name
- light and dark looked at separately (low contrast shows up in only one)
- phone cut: content cut off at the edges, captions covering the UI
- the same fake scenario everywhere

Real-app footage, also check:

- each scene shows the right moment of its recording, not an earlier frame (a long recording in a short scene is where this goes wrong)
- the text in the recording is sharp at the zoom the camera uses
- the phone cut follows the part of the page the voice talks about
- every moment that must match a sound: the word spoken and the word on screen land together

To find a moment in a recording (a bar appearing, a price changing), `node scripts/scan.mjs <video.mp4> <x,y,w,h>` prints when that box changes colour. To measure how far the page lags a sound, make a tile of frames with their times (`ffmpeg -ss <s> -t 2 -i <video.mp4> -vf "fps=10,scale=480:-1,tile=5x4" tile.jpg`) and look.

Fix, run the stills again for the changed scenes (`<scene>@<frame>` picks a frame, for example `add@60`), repeat. Only then render.

## Render

```
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/video-render.mjs" <appDir> <tag>:light
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/video-render.mjs" <appDir> <tag>:dark <tag>:light::vertical <tag>:light::silent
```

A cut is `<tag>:<theme>[:<music>][:silent][:vertical]`. Cuts run one after the other. For each one the script prints:

- the mp4 path and a contact sheet path. Read the sheet.
- a dead-air warning if a stretch of 0.5 s or more is frozen. Fix it: lower `minSec` or `holdSec` in the script and run the voice step again (voice for lines that did not change is reused, so it costs nothing extra), or add motion (`Drift`) to that moment. `--strict` makes dead air a failure.
- loudness: average and loudest level, and a note if the sound may crackle or is too quiet.

After every render: nothing cropped wrongly, late animations not cut off, voice clear, no wrong claims. Silent cut: the captions read well without sound.

## Music (optional)

None ships. To add one: a royalty-free source whose licence you have read and that allows this use (for example Mixkit's free stock music, which allows commercial use; on its tag pages each track's mp3 address follows its title, and the file's length must match the listing). Ask the student before downloading anything, and tell them the file, the source and its size; normalise it (`ffmpeg -i in.mp3 -af "loudnorm=I=-16:TP=-1.5:LRA=11" -ar 48000 -b:a 192k public/music/<name>.mp3`); render with `<tag>:light:<name>`; record the source and licence in `public/music/SOURCES.txt`. Avoid sources that only allow YouTube use or non-commercial use. The music is ducked under the voice automatically.

## Memory and disk

- Each render adds several MB to `video/out/`. Delete old renders when you are done (`out/` is not committed).
- A render needs a few GB of free disk to work in; `video-render.mjs` will not start one with less than 3 GB free, and it removes Remotion's working folder (about 250 MB per render) from the temp folder afterwards.
- "Could not extract frame from compositor ... disk space is low" or "TypeError: Failed to fetch" means the computer ran out of memory or disk, not a bug in the scenes. The engine tries such a render once more by itself, one frame at a time. If that fails too, close other apps, free disk space, and render again with `--low-memory` (one frame at a time, a smaller frame cache: slower). Long real-app footage needs it most.
- One render at a time, in the foreground, on the whole computer. `video-render.mjs` does not start while another video render runs (another project or chat), and never removes that render's working folder. Never check with `pgrep -l` or `-fl`: they print other programs' settings, keys included.
