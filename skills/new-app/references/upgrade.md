# General app: the full Shipyard standard

Use this when `which-app.mjs` prints `general`. The app already exists and Shipyard did not make it. There is no `.shipyard-app.json`. That is normal.

This is a different procedure from design, ops, launch and video. Those scripts will refuse the folder. The refusal is expected. It is not a reason to stop, and it is not a reason to only change the easy things.

The result is the same standard as an app Shipyard made, fitted to this stack. Do the whole list. A colour tweak, a font swap, or a dark-mode line on its own is not finished work.

## What stays theirs

Their stack, their pages, their brand. Do not paste the Shipyard template over the app. Do not run `apply-design.mjs`, `ops-setup.mjs`, `ops-status.mjs`, `launch-check.mjs`, `verify.mjs`, or the provision scripts. Those need a Shipyard app. The video scripts are the one exception, and only after this whole guide is done (section 6).

## What they still get

All of it:

- Secrets stay out of git and out of the browser.
- Sign-in cannot be taken over from an email address alone.
- Each person only sees their own data (row level security, or the same rule in this stack).
- Paid calls have a cap.
- Tests exist, and a check runs on every pull request, including a leaked-key scan.
- The publishing branch is not where day-to-day work lands.
- Privacy, terms, a 404 page, a favicon, robots and a sitemap.
- Empty states, error states, system light and dark, no fake numbers, no em dashes in text people read. The behaviour rules in `build-rules.md`.
- A real look, proposed properly (three directions, light and dark), then built into their existing styles. Not a one-colour edit.

If they asked to review and improve the app, or to make it better, that is a yes to this whole list. Ask only before a step that spends money, takes a real payment, or deletes data.

## 1. Audit (read only)

Read the code. Answer with file names. Do not edit yet.

- **Secrets**: keys in tracked files, `NEXT_PUBLIC_` or similar prefixes on secrets, `.env` files in git, a `.gitignore` that covers them.
- **Sign-in**: passwords set from an email alone, redirect values not checked, login cookie handling, public versus protected routes.
- **Data isolation**: does each person only see their own data? Row level security on every table? Admin flags editable by users? Server key used in browser code?
- **Costs**: AI or paid API calls without caps, keys shared between apps.
- **Server time**: measure it, do not guess: `vercel metrics vercel.function_invocation.function_cpu_time_ms -p <project> -a sum --group-by route --since 30d`, then again with `--group-by clientUserAgent`, and the same for `vercel.middleware_invocation.function_cpu_time_ms`. The bill can be about twice these numbers, because waking from idle is not counted per call. Look for one route or caller far above the rest, then check the app against "Hosting costs" in `build-rules.md`.
- **Tests and checks**: tests exist and run? A test gate on pull requests? A leaked-key scan? Does CI run the type check (`tsc --noEmit`) before the tests? Is `next lint` still in `package.json` on Next 16 (it no longer exists)?
- **API routes and AI**: a signed-out call to an API route answers 401 JSON, not a redirect to sign-in. Server-key deletes or writes steered by a path the person can change check the prefix and owner. The browser cannot choose the AI model on the app's key; AI, speech and MCP routes have per-person rate limits and body size caps (MCP: a batch cap, a charge per tool call). Lookups with typed keys use `Object.hasOwn`. Deleting data does not reset usage counters. Debounced saves flush on `pagehide`.
- **Deploy**: pushing straight to the publishing branch, deployment protection, environment values.
- **Phone and behaviour**: phone layout, system light and dark, empty and error states, fake numbers or reviews, em dashes, the copy rules in `build-rules.md`.
- **Legal and basics**: privacy and terms pages, 404 page, favicon, robots, sitemap.
- **Look**: what is hard-coded, what is one accent with no dark pair, what a visitor cannot read. This feeds the proposal. It is not the whole job.
- **Lessons**: go through `lessons.md` and mark which apply.

For a big app (hundreds of files, several features) or after another agent added a lot of code, offer the review skill (`/shipyard:review`): it runs this audit with one helper per area and a skeptic for every finding, then fixes in waves and reviews the fixes again. It uses a large share of the student's plan, so say that first.

## 2. Report

A short list sorted by risk: **Fix now** (secrets, data leaks, account takeover), **Should fix**, **Nice to have**. For each: one plain sentence about what could go wrong for their users, then the file. End with what you could not check. Include the look and the non-visual gaps in the same list. Do not hide the hard ones.

## 3. Propose the look

Read the design skill's `references/propose.md` and `references/directions.md`. Draft three directions that are really different, each a light and dark pair. Use the app's real words.

`node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/theme-packs.mjs" mock <appDir>/.shipyard/design/directions.json --out <appDir>/.shipyard/design/directions.html`

That script does not need a Shipyard app. Show the page. When they pick one (or they already said to improve the look), write that pair into the app's own styles: colours, type, spacing, corners, buttons, empty states, light and dark. Do not run `apply-design.mjs`. If they only wanted the audit, stop after the report.

## 4. Do the rest

After the report, do every **Fix now** item, then **Should fix**, unless they named a smaller list. One area at a time. Smallest change that meets the rule. Add a test where there is logic. A look-only pass is not this step.

## 5. Stack differences

- **Next.js with Supabase**: use the template's pieces as the model (proxy, cookies, migrations with row level security, `secret-scan.mjs`, `.github/workflows/test.yml`, `AGENTS.md`). Copy the idea, adapt names.
- **Other stacks** (Flutter, plain HTML, other servers): no template. Turn each rule into a check that fits their stack, and say clearly what could not be automated. For mobile apps, a web version can be built later with `/shipyard:new-app` and share the same Supabase project.

## 6. Finish

Run the app's own tests. Summarise what now matches the standard and what is left, with the reason. Offer to record any new lesson in `~/.shipyard/learnings.md`.

When no **Fix now** item is left and the app is live, offer the video in one line, and start it only on a yes: "Want a short product video of your app with an AI voice (`/shipyard:video`)? It takes 2 to 4 hours of back-and-forth and a big share of your plan's usage, and the voice costs a few cents per minute." The video skill then runs its scripts with `--general` (see its "First: which app is this?"). Not before: a video brings visitors, so the app must be safe for them first.
